1.Use App component for navigation
eg.

2. Main context component that provides the Memes data
3.All components that use the memes data get it from there 
-This will enable the app state and ui to be in sync with the server
eg. 
Memes collection is where all the memes are displayed
Update meme component allows a user to change a specific meme
When the fetch to update a meme is run, 
Memes collection should automatically update because 
Update Meme component will be changing its state directly through their shared context
